```

## How to use:

### RPTree.py
this python file contains the `BinaryTree` class, which performs the following tasks:
- `construct_tree`
- `get_leaf_nodes`
- `preorder_search`

### RunMain.py
this python file contains the driver code to create `BinaryTree` instance, then performs the following tasks:
- pick a random test sample, and remove it from the dataset.
- create the rpTree from the dataset.
- perform k-nn search on the rpTree to find the nearest neighbors for the test sample.
